# Channels error
Channels count do not match (SamplesPerPixel, ExtraSamples and BitsPerSample must have consistency).
# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) a TIFF file can be edited in order to change the SamplesPerPixel value.
Also the cardinalities of the tags ExtraSamples and BitsPerSample can be modified to simulate incoherent channels.
