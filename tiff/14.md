# Bad Offset
IFD or tags offsets pointing outside the file or inside the Image File Header, or reused offsets (offset points or overlapping to already used data).

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) change the offset of a tag and set it to an invalid number.
- A value between 0 and 7 which corresponds to the TIFF header.
- A value greater than the file size.
- The same value for two different tags.
