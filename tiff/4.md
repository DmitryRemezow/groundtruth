# Incompatible tag type
TIFF using a tag with incorrect and incompatible type.
# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) a TIFF file can be edited in order to change a tag type.
Look for the tag signature and change the value in the type field with an invalid and incompatible value.
For example, change the type of a SHORT typed tag to ASCII.

A tag signature is an 8-byte hexadecimal value where its two first bytes contain the tag id, the two following bytes contain the tag type and the 4 last bytes contain the tag cardinality.
The TIFF reference documentation contains a list of the available tags, with its ids, accepted types, and valid cardinalities.
