# Unexpected tag type
The valid tag types as defined in the TIFF Baseline 6.0 are:
1 = BYTE
2 = ASCII
3 = SHORT
4 = LONG
5 = RATIONAL
6 = SBYTE
7 = UNDEFINED
8 = SSHORT
9 = SLONG
10 = SRATIONAL
11 = FLOAT
12 = DOUBLE

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) change the type of any tag to a non-valid value.
Tag type is set in the bytes 2-3 of each IFD entry (tag).
