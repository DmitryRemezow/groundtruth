# CMYK
Rules for CMYK images:
- The cardinality of the InkSet tag must be 1.
- The InkNames field must exist when InkSet is 2.

Invalid tags:
- GrayResponseCurve, GrayResponseUnit should not be present, as it is only valid for Grayscale images.
- Threshholding tag should not be present, as is only valid with Grayscale images.
- CellLength, CellWidth should not be present, as it is only for bilevel images.
- ColorMap should not be present, as is only used for Palette images.
- TransferRange should not be used as it is defined only for RGB and YCbCr PhotometricInterpretations.
- YCbCrCoefficients, YCbCrSubsampleHoriz, YCbCrSubsampleVert, YCbCrSubSampling, YCbCrPositioning tags should not be present since are only used in YCbCr images.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) edit the tags and its values.
The InkSet tag id is 332 (hex `0x014C`).
The InkNames tag id is 333 (hex `0x014D`).
