# Grayscale
Rules for Grayscale images:
- The valid compressions for grayscale images are 1, 32773.
- GrayResponseUnit is only useful when GrayResponseCurve is defined.

Invalid tags:
- CellLength, CellWidth should not be present, as it is only for bilevel images.
- ColorMap should not be present, as is only used for Palette images.
- InkSet, InkNames, NumberOfInks, DotRange, TargetPrinter should not be present, as are only used for CMYK images.
- TransferRange should not be used as it is defined only for RGB and YCbCr PhotometricInterpretations.
- YCbCrCoefficients, YCbCrSubsampleHoriz, YCbCrSubsampleVert, YCbCrSubSampling, YCbCrPositioning tags should not be present since are only used in YCbCr images.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) edit the tags and its values.
The Compression tag id is 259 (hex `0x0103`).
The GrayResponseUnit tag id is 290 (hex `0x0122`).
