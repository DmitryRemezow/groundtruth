# Transparency Mask
Rules for transparency mask images:
- BitsPerSample must be 1.
- SamplesPerPixel must be 1.
- If NewSubfileType defines a transparency mask the PhotometricInterpretation value must be 4.

Invalid tags:
- GrayResponseCurve, GrayResponseUnit should not be present, as it is only valid for Grayscale images.
- Threshholding tag should not be present, as is only valid with Grayscale images.
- CellLength, CellWidth should not be present, as it is only for bilevel images.
- ColorMap should not be present, as is only used for Palette images.
- InkSet, InkNames, NumberOfInks, DotRange, TargetPrinter should not be present, as are only used for CMYK images.
- TransferRange should not be used as it is defined only for RGB and YCbCr PhotometricInterpretations.
- YCbCrCoefficients, YCbCrSubsampleHoriz, YCbCrSubsampleVert, YCbCrSubSampling, YCbCrPositioning tags should not be present since are only used in YCbCr images.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) edit the tags and its values.
The BitsPerSample tag id is 258 (hex `0x0102`).
The ColorMap tag id is 277 (hex `0x0115`).

Change the photometric interpretation of a non-transpaency mask image to 4.
