# Tag cardinality
Incorrect cardinality in a tag (other cardinality than specified in TIFF reference)
# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) a TIFF file can be edited in order to change a tag cardinality.
Look for the tag signature and change the value in the cardinality field with an invalid value.

A tag signature is an 8-byte hexadecimal value where its two first bytes contain the tag id, the two following bytes contain the tag type and the 4 last bytes contain the tag cardinality.
Tag ids and types can be found in the TIFF reference documentation, together with its accepted cardinality.
