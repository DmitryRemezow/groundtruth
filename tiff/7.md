# Resolution error
Missing Resolution (XResolution and YResolution tags) or declared with a zero value.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) the value of tags XResolution and YResolution can be set to zero.
A tag deletion can be also simulated by changing the tag id of some existing tag.
