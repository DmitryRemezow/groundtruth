# Bilevel
Rules for Bilevel images:
- The compression tag for bilevel images must be either 1, 2, or 32773.
- CellLength, CellWidth should only be present if Threshholding is 2.
- If compression is 2 then BitsPerSample must be 1.

Invalid tags:
- GrayResponseCurve, GrayResponseUnit should not be present, as it is only valid for Grayscale images.
- Threshholding tag should not be present, as is only valid with Grayscale images.
- ColorMap should not be present, as is only used for Palette images.
- InkSet, InkNames, NumberOfInks, DotRange, TargetPrinter should not be present, as are only used for CMYK images.
- TransferRange should not be used as it is defined only for RGB and YCbCr PhotometricInterpretations.
- YCbCrCoefficients, YCbCrSubsampleHoriz, YCbCrSubsampleVert, YCbCrSubSampling, YCbCrPositioning tags should not be present since are only used in YCbCr images.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) edit the tags and its values.
The Compression tag id is 259 (hex `0x0103`).
The BitsPerSample tag id is 258 (hex `0x0102`).
The CellLength tag id is 265 (hex `0x0109`).
The CellWidth tag id is 264 (hex `0x0108`).
