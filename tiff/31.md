# YCbCr
Rules for YCbCr images:
- ReferenceBlackWhite must be defined.
- YCbCr images can either be stored as uncompressed(1) data or compressed with the LZW(5) or JPEG(6) algorithm.

Invalid tags:
- GrayResponseCurve, GrayResponseUnit should not be present, as it is only valid for Grayscale images.
- Threshholding tag should not be present, as is only valid with Grayscale images.
- CellLength, CellWidth should not be present, as it is only for bilevel images.
- ColorMap should not be present, as is only used for Palette images.

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) edit the tags and its values.

Change the photometric interpretation of a non-transpaency mask image to 4.
