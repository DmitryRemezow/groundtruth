# Byte Order
A TIFF file must be encoded in either little endian or big endian.
The endianess of a TIFF is defined in its first two bytes, which are `4D4D` for little endian, or `4949` for big endian

# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) change the first two bytes to any other value than the valid ones.

## Generate
Change the extension of a non-TIFF file to ".tiff".
