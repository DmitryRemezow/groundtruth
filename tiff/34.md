# Bad Ascii7 format
Tags with Ascii format containing non-7 bits ascii, Ascii without null character termination, more than one null between strings.
# Reproducibility
## Simulate
With an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD) a TIFF file can be edited in order to change the value of an ASCII field.
Some ASCII tags include:
- Make
- Model
- ImageDescription
- Artist
- Copyright
To put a non ASCII field, change the byte of any of these fields to a value higher than 127 (`7F` in hexadecimal).
Substitute the null character with a non-null value (greater than 0).
Put more than one null byte into the string.

## Generate
Open the properties of a TIFF file in Windows, and change the value of any text field inserting accents or any language specific character.
