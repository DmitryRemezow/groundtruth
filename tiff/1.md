# BigTiff
The TIFF file has 64-bit offsets (instead of 32) allowing for bigger size images.
# Reproducibility
## Simulate
A BigTIFF file can be simulated by manipulating its header.
Open the TIFF file with an Hexadecimal Editor (e.g. HxD)

1. Change the bytes 2-3 to the decimal value 43 (`2B` in hexadecimal).
2. Note that if the first two bytes of the TIFF file have the value `4D4D` it means little endian, therefore 43 is `002B`, and if the two first bytes are `4949` it means big endian and therefore 43 is `2B00`.

## Generate
BigTIFF files may be generated with editors that are able to write in this format.
