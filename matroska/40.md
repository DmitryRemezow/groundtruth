# FFV1-HEADER-bits_per_raw_sample

## Name

bits_per_raw_sample coherency.

## Definition

bits_per_raw_sample should not be more than 64. 

## Note

Actually any bits_per_raw_sample value is valid but in practice high number are not real; as in the future it could be up to 64 bit (there are float 64-bit/component content), we arbitrary choose to consider any value >64 as actually with high potential of being an error.
It was decided by specification authors that a value of 0 is valid, and should be considered as 8, as it is used in some old encoders, so it is not an error.

## Reproducibility

Get FFmpeg source code, configure it, then:
 
```sh
mv libavcodec/ffv1enc.c ffv1enc.c
sed -e 's/put_symbol(c, state, f->bits_per_raw_sample, 0);/put_symbol(c, state, 65, 0);/g' ffv1enc.c > libavcodec/ffv1enc.c
make
mv ffv1enc.c libavcodec/ffv1enc.c
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "color=c=black:size=2x2" -vframes 1 -pix_fmt gray8 -write_crc32 0 -c:v ffv1 -level 1 FFV1-HEADER-bits_per_raw_sample_MS_v1.mkv
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "color=c=black:size=2x2" -vframes 1 -pix_fmt gray8 -write_crc32 0 -c:v ffv1 -level 3 -slices 1 FFV1-HEADER-bits_per_raw_sample_MS_v3.mkv
```
