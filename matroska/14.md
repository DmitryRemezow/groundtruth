# MKV-KNOWN-ELEM

## Name

Element ID Registered

## Definition

Ensure MKV Element ID is registered in specdata.xml (as of 2014-12-13 this is 224 registered Element IDs).

## Note
Deprecated. The tests for `NO-JUNK-IN-FIXEDSIZE_MATROSKA` and `EBML-ELEMENT-VALID-PARENT` make this test redundant, since any known Element would have a known Parent Element and another unrecognized Element would be considered junk which is only conditionally valid is elements that allow unknown sizes.
