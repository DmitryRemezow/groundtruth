# EBML-VINT-EFF

## Note
This test has been deprecated because it would require an invalid Matroska definition to support.

## Reference

> The VINT_DATA component of the Element ID MUST be encoded at the shortest valid length. For example, an Element ID with binary encoding of 1011 1111 is valid, whereas an Element ID with binary encoding of 0100 0000 0011 1111 stores a semantically equal VINT_DATA but is invalid because a shorter VINT encoding is possible.
