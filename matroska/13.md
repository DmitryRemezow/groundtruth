# EBML-VINT-EFF

## Name

EBML vint efficiency (Deprecated).

## Definition

Section 2.2 "IDs are always encoded in their shortest form e.g. 1 is always encoded as 0x81 and never as 0x4001." The bits following the Element ID's Length Descriptor are not more than (8 - ${bit-length-of-length-descriptor}) successive 0 bits i.e. vint is expressed as efficiently as feasible.

## Note

Deprecated. It would require an invalid Matroska definition to support.

## Reference

> The VINT_DATA component of the Element ID MUST be encoded at the shortest valid length. For example, an Element ID with binary encoding of 1011 1111 is valid, whereas an Element ID with binary encoding of 0100 0000 0011 1111 stores a semantically equal VINT_DATA but is invalid because a shorter VINT encoding is possible.
