# Breaks/Boundaries

| PDF/A version | Conformance level | Class type  | Severity |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------  | -------- |
|               |                   |             |          |

The PDF/A document _has not_ any word breaks.

Detection of word breaks requires natural language analysis, which is also based on heuristics and has about 80-85% of accuracy. Implementing this kind of checks in PDF/A validation is not practical, as it would often lead to unpredictable result.
