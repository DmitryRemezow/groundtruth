The ActualText value shall be used as a replacement, not a description, for the content, providing text that is equivalent to what a person would see when viewing the content (see PDF reference, sec. 14.9.4)
CANNOT BE CHECKED
Detecting the content that requires ActualText replacement requires human intervention and is not well-defined by just data in the PDF document. The same content may or may not require ActualText alternative depending on the author's intention.
