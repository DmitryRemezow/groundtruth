# ActualText

| PDF/A version | Conformance level | Class type  | Severity |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------  | -------- |
|               |                   |             |          |

The PDF/A document _has not_ a value for ActualText.

The ActualText value shall be used as a replacement, not a description, for the content, providing text that is equivalent to what a person would see when viewing the content [see PDF reference, sec. 14.9.4].

Detecting the content that requires ActualText replacement requires human intervention and is not well-defined by just data in the PDF document. The same content may or may not require ActualText alternative depending on the author's intention.
